# The Northern Land

![Glimpse of the Nanda Devi Peak from Auli](./images-northern-land/nandadevi.png)

This is a test. After a hectic and somewhat monotonous ninth semester, a break was long due. The winter holidays came to the rescue and my mom planned our trip up north India. The whole itinerary was a suspense to me and all I knew is that first we are going to Rishikesh to my Mausi's (Mom's sister, a.k.a Aunt) house. I was coming from Chennai and my parents from Mumbai and the rendezvous point was at the Jolly Grant International Airport right in the middle of Dehradun and Rishikesh. At the small but new and modern airport, we were greeted by my very healthy and friendly Mausaji (Uncle). On the way home, he updated us on the life of my cousin sisters, entertained us with funny tales, and awed me about a 400 occupancy cinema in Rishikesh! Rishikesh is a town in the state of Uttarakhand, India. It surrounds the holy Ganges and is a spot of rituals, adventure and spiritual upliftment. On reaching home, we quickly freshened up, had a cup of tea and then my uncle took me on a scooter ride to the city. In Rishikesh, everyone first takes the blessing of mother Ganga before opening their business or going to work for the day.

My uncle took me to Triveni Ghat, a riverside area where people can bathe in the holy waters or offer their prayers to mother Ganga. The calming flow of the river sparkling under the sun, the cold breeze and the mighty mountains in the background set a perfect spot to sit and ponder on life's deepest questions. However, now wasn't the time, we quickly touched the holy waters, offered a few minutes of prayer and were on our way to explore. My uncle took me to his office, shared with me about the various organizations he is part of and all the noble social work which they are doing. While he was going through some office papers, I started showing signs of fatigue, a result of my early morning flight. He noticed and we went back home. At home we waited for my Aunt to return from work and then had a hearty Pahadi (of the mountains) lunch. It consisted of a cooked green leafy vegetable which I vaguely remember as being called as lai. It is available only in the mountains. For the next two days, I put my stomach under a lot of work as my Uncle and Aunt served me delicious exclusive Pahadi cuisine, like Ras Bath, fresh homemade white butter, Raddish Parothas, Dal Batti and my Uncle's famous salad burger which consists of a bottom layer of turnip, middle layer of tomato and a top layer of raddish, rubbed with salt. I was eating way past my normal appetite but I felt hungry more often due to the chilly weather and of course who says no to tasty home cooked food!

The day came when we packed some warm clothes and left for an adventure higher up north in search of cold white powder (snow). The destination was Auli (a.k.a the Switzerland of India). On the way we had to halt multiple times due to mountain construction work. The Rail Vikas Nigam Limited (Govt) is building a railway line from Rishikesh to Karanprayag and the route passes through the inside of multiple mountains. I met the head of the project and although he is retired, the government still wants him cause he's the only expert for mountain boring! (Core engineering, unlike computer science makes you irreplaceable with experience). While debating whether the train was necessary and the effects of disturbing mother nature, we passed through Devprayag, the origin of the Ganges where two rivers Alakhnanda and Bhagirathi merge.

By evening, we halted at Joshimath, just below Auli since it is not allowed to drive past 8 pm in the mountains. The next day we resumed our hunt for snow, and finally we started finding a few patches of powdered snow blanketing the shoulder of the roads. As per the locals, it used to snow a lot a few years ago during December but thanks to Global Warming, it doesn't anymore. The view was scenic and my watch told me that we were 2905 meters above sea level! To go further up, either one had to trek or take a horse. As a distinguished 1890s gentlemen, I chose to ride a horse. The horse ride with the breathtaking view of the snow capped mountains gave me Red Dead Redemption 2 vibes (a famous video game). I assumed I was Arthur Morgan (the game character) and commenced the climb. On reaching the top, my watch told me I was at 3242m. I had reached Gulshan Valley.

I was on my own since my parents decided to stay down. Here, there were more patches of snow and it was dense. Without wasting further time, I played with the powdered snow and made embarrassing videos of myself sliding down thick snow. It was fun, but a desire to watch snowfall remained.

We left Auli and explored further. We came across a small spot of hot springs. The water here coming from beneath the Earth was steaming hot! On one side there were snow capped mountains around and here was a spot with hot boiling water, what a wonderful nature indeed.

The next day, we left Joshimath to the city of New Tehri. Due to the curved and narrow paths in the mountains, even a short distance takes a lot of time compared to the plains. It was dusk by the time we reached Tehri. The city was settled on the mountains and from far away the city lights gave an illusion of a mountain of sparkling diamonds. The day ended.

Next morning, the weather was cloudy subtracting a few numbers from the temperature. Through special permission from my Jijaji's (sister's husband) connect, we got the once in a lifetime opportunity to see the Majestic Tehri Dam from the inside! Tehri dam is the tallest dam in India and the 13th tallest dam in the world! The construction of this dam led to the total submergence of thirty seven villages including a palace of the then king. We were shown inside the dam (which was inside a mountain!) by a kind CISF personnel and he kindly answered all my technical questions about the insane engineering and the team that went through behind the dam. Looking at this majestic artificial mountain made me realize the potential of science and team work.

After Tehri, it was time to go back to Rishikesh with a stop at the Sarkunda Devi Temple. The temple was at a mountain peak and one had to climb a kilometer on foot to reach the temple.

But fortunately for us, on reaching the foot of the peak, the goddess had already answered our prayers. A mild snow storm started! It was a first time experience for me and my parents to see snow fall and boy it was beautiful! After couple of photos and videos paired with hot tea in the snow, we finally left back home to Rishikesh.

This new day was pretty much a rest day. I got totally bored by noon and my mind was cloudy. So I decided to take a 3km walk to Triveni Ghat. The weather was pleasant and the roads were buzzing with traffic. Children were coming from school, tourists were stuck in traffic and the roadside shops were in full activity. The Triveni Ghat area also hosts the main market of Rishikesh. People were selling jaggery sweets and warm sweaters, one could hear a child giggling, a lady negotiating with a shopkeeper, two friends walking carelessly with clasped hands, a lively street indeed. That's what I like about India, unlike other countries I've been to every street in India is a happening place. If you are feeling cloudy, lonely or down, just take a stroll in your nearby street and observe people! On reaching the river side, I sat near mother Ganga and just admired the beauty surrounding me. People were offering their prayers, small children were trying to sell food for fish while the evening orange sun warmed everyone. Shortly, I got a call from my mom and I was ordered to get samosas and cake for my aunt's tuition kids as a christmas gift. I went to the nearby famous Sweets and Snacks shop, helped myself with a plate of Pani Puri, packed Samosas and hurried my way back in a tuk tuk. (A vehicle)

The next two days we travelled to Dehradun, Haldwani and Bhowali to meet other two Mausis and some relatives.

Finally my didi (elder cousin sister) came home for new year vacations and took me on a scooter ride through Rishikesh. For the ride my uncle gave me a Garhwali Cap which is a traditional cap of the mountain people. My didi patiently showed me spots which my Uncle had missed through maze like lanes to avoid the buzzing traffic. She treated me with tasty hazelnut hot chocolate and honey drizzled pancakes. We updated each other about our lives and took a nice walk at Marine Drive which is a nice riverbank belt. I wish I could be as friendly and good natured as my sister.

It was the last night in Rishikesh and we spend some time chatting, packing and photo sessions. The next day we bid adieu and left for Mount Abu in Rajasthan.

The ten days or so of stay in and near the mountains was recharging and calming. As we left from Rishikesh, a wish to stay longer remained. A big thank you to my Aunt, sister and especially my Uncle for hosting us. I learnt a lot of things from my Uncle. At his work I observed him talk kindly, respectfully and with authority to his employees. He has the skill (and as Gen Z says, rizz) to easily befriend a stranger within seconds and start talking endlessly with them. One day when we went to eat Jalebi (an Indian sweet), he started talking to the chef and within seconds they were talking about where they grew up and about the current happenings in the city as though they were childhood friends. He has such good relations with his neighbours that one day when we wanted to go to another city, he enquired with one of the neighbours whether they knew of a taxi but instead the neighbours immediately offered him to take their car. Even children like him more than their own mom. He is also a very good cook and I will miss his Pahadi khichidi (rice mixed with lentils). He loves hindi action movies and has the heart of a teen boy. His energy levels are unmatched for a person his age. It taught me that in the end, your status, money, house doesn't matter much. All that matters is how you make people feel around you, how trustworthy are you and how kind you are..

With our homeboy Earth completing yet another revolution around the sun, 2024 comes to an end. Lots of new experiences and learnings this year, looking ahead to even more amazing experiences and learnings the next year. Whoever is reading this, I wish you a very Happy New Year filled with Love, Peace, Travel, Learnings and Joy!
